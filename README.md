# GhostSec - Cybersecurity Learning Platform

GhostSec is a comprehensive cybersecurity learning and testing platform that provides isolated environments for various security disciplines, including malware analysis, penetration testing, bug bounty hunting, and secure programming.

## Features

### Learning Environments

1. **Malware Analysis Lab**
   - Secure sandboxed environment
   - Static and dynamic analysis tools
   - YARA rule scanning
   - Network activity monitoring
   - Comprehensive reporting

2. **Bug Bounty Lab**
   - Kali Linux-based environment
   - Common security tools
   - Vulnerable practice applications
   - Structured challenges
   - Point-based progression

3. **Penetration Testing Lab**
   - Full Kali Linux toolkit
   - Network isolation
   - Vulnerable target systems
   - Advanced scanning tools
   - Exploitation frameworks

4. **Programming Environments**
   - Python development environment
   - C/C++ development environment
   - C# development environment
   - Code analysis tools
   - Secure testing frameworks

### Security Features

- Docker-based isolation
- Network separation
- Controlled execution
- Resource monitoring
- Comprehensive logging

## Requirements

- Python 3.10+
- Docker
- 8GB RAM minimum (16GB recommended)
- 50GB free disk space
- Windows/Linux operating system

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/ghostsec.git
cd ghostsec
```

2. Install dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

3. Install Docker if not already installed:
   - [Docker Desktop for Windows](https://docs.docker.com/desktop/windows/install/)
   - [Docker for Linux](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/)

4. Configure environment:
```bash
cp .env.example .env
# Edit .env with your settings
```

5. Initialize the application:
```bash
python setup.py install
```

## Usage

1. Start the platform:
```bash
python ghostsec_app.py
```

2. Access the web interface:
```
http://localhost:5000
```

3. Create learning environments:
```python
from ghostsec.learning_environments import MalwareLab, BugBountyLab, PentestingLab

# Create malware analysis lab
malware_lab = MalwareLab("my_workspace")
malware_lab.setup_environment()

# Create bug bounty lab
bounty_lab = BugBountyLab("bug_bounty")
bounty_lab.setup_environment()

# Create pentesting lab
pentest_lab = PentestingLab("pentest")
pentest_lab.setup_environment()
```

## Security Considerations

1. **Isolation**: All environments run in isolated Docker containers
2. **Network Security**: Separate networks for different environments
3. **Resource Control**: Limited resource allocation per container
4. **Access Control**: Role-based access to different environments
5. **Monitoring**: Comprehensive logging and activity monitoring
