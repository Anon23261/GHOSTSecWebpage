python manage.py createsuperuser
```

7. Start development server:
```bash
python manage.py runserver
```

## Dependencies

- Python 3.10+
- Redis (for Channels and Celery)
- PostgreSQL (recommended for production)
- Additional system packages for malware analysis

## Development Setup

1. Install Redis:
```bash
# Windows: Download from https://redis.io/download
# Linux:
sudo apt-get install redis-server
```

2. Start Celery worker:
```bash
celery -A ghostsec worker -l info
```

3. Start Celery beat (for scheduled tasks):
```bash
celery -A ghostsec beat -l info
```

## Production Deployment

1. Set up production environment:
```bash
python manage.py check --deploy
```

2. Configure settings:
- Update ALLOWED_HOSTS
- Set DEBUG = False
- Configure secure SSL/TLS
- Set up proper database (PostgreSQL recommended)

3. Collect static files:
```bash
python manage.py collectstatic
```

4. Use gunicorn for deployment:
```bash
gunicorn ghostsec.wsgi:application
```

## Security Considerations

- All uploaded malware samples are handled in isolated environments
- Strict access controls and permissions system
- Regular security audits and updates
- Comprehensive logging and monitoring
- SSL/TLS encryption enforced
- CSRF and XSS protection enabled
- Content Security Policy implemented
